# PEBakery.LZ4Lib

C# wrapper for [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) library.

## Status

PEBakery.LZ4Lib is similar or slower (~10x) than pure C# implementation, [K4os.Compression.LZ4](https://github.com/MiloszKrajewski/K4os.Compression.LZ4). Overhead of P/Invoke can be one reason. May be discontinued if `K4os.Compression.LZ4` is well maintained.

## License

PEBakery.LZ4Lib is licensed under 2-Clause BSD License, same as lz4.
